<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sour cream and onion, spinach-artichoke, queso and fondue are warm dips you know and love, but 
    we'd urge you toget to know Buffalo chicken dip a little better. Itâ€™s a quick, one-pan snack, 
    spicy from a heavy pour of hot sauce, luscious from sour cream and cream cheese and a little funky 
    from the blue cheese. With just the right amount of acid and salt, it'll keep people coming back 
    for more. It also plays well with beer, but that you already knew.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 cups shredded, cooked chicken</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Buffalo-style hot sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>4 oz cream cheese, cut into pieces and softened</li>
    <li>1/2 cup freshly shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup crumbled blue cheese</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp finely chopped chives, or to taste</li>
    <li>Celery sticks, carrot sticks, bread, potato chips, and/or tortilla chips, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the oven to 375 degrees. In an 8-inch cast-iron or ovenproof skillet, melt the butter over
        medium-high heat. Add the chick and hot sauce and simmer until the sauce has thickened and
        reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Turn off the heat, then stir in the lemon juice, sour cream and cream cheese until combined. 
        Sprinkle the Cheddar cheese over the top.
    </li>
    <li>Bake until bubbling around the edges and the cheese has melted, about 10 minutes. If you'd like
        the top to get browned, run it under the broiler for a minute or two.
    </li>
    <li>Immediately garnish with blue cheese and chives. Serve with chips, bread or vegetables for 
        dipping.</li>
</ol>
