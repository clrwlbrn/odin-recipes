<h1>Brown Buttered Shrimp with Ginger-y Tomato Broth and Lotsa Lime</h1>
<img src="../img/shrimp-recipe.jpeg">

<h2>Description</h2> 
<p>This recipe for tomato-y shrimp with ginger, lime and fresh herbs from Molly
    Baz is definitely in my top 5. There's a little spice, a bunch of butter,
    and fresh herbs on top. Some people serve this over rice or noodles but
    the way that I believe it should be served is with <em>only</em> crusty
    bread and some very cold butter slathered liberally with salt and pepper on top.
    That way you can use the bread to sop up all the extra sauce.
    <br>
    <br>
    I highly recommend buying peeled and deveined shrimp. It will ensure the prep
    and cook time is less and then you get to enjoy your food sooner! If they don't
    have this pre-packaged at your local store, the fish counter should be able to
    do it for you if you have the time to wait!

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 yellow onion</li>
    <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>2" knob of ginger</li>
    <li>3 limes</li>
    <li>Handful of cilantro or basil leaves</li>
    <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 tbsp double concentrated tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tbsp sambal oelek</li>
    <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter, plus more for serving</li>
    <li>Baguette, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3> Do Some Prep</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cut one yellow onion in half through the root end. Finely chop the 
        onion</li>
    <li>Thinly slice 6 garlic cloves.</li>
    <li>Finely chop a 2" knob of ginger (feel free to peel it if first if
        you want but I usually don't bother).</li>
    <li>Season 1 pound of peeled and deveined shrimp with salt.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cook the Shrimp and Build the Sauce</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium heat for several 
        minutes. Swirl in 3 tablespoons of butter.</li>
    <li>Once the butter has melted, add the shrimp in a single layer and cook,
        shking the pan occasionally but not flipping untile they are well
        browned underneath, 2-3 minutes. Flip the shrimp and cook 15 seconds
        longer on the second side before transferring to a plate. They will go
        back in the sauces at the end so not to worry if they seem barely cooked
        just yet. The worst thing you can do is overcook them.
    </li>
    <li>Add 1 more tablespoon of butter to the skillet along with the chopped 
        onions.
    </li>
    <li>Season the onions with salt, and cook, stirring often, until the onions
        begin to sizzle and brown at the edges, 5-7 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Stir in the garlic, and ginger, and cook until just about to brown at
        the edges, 1-2 minutes longer.
    </li>
    <li>Stir in 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and cook until the tomato paste
        sticks to the pan a bit, 2 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Stir in 2 cups of water, and 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 or 2 tablespoons
        of sambal oelek (depending on how spicy you like things) and bring the 
        broth to a simmer over medium heat. 
    </li>
    <li>Simmer, until reduced and saucy but as thick as tomato sauce, 6-9 minutes.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Finish and Serve</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Add the shrimp back into the skillet along with any juices on the plate.
        Squeeze in the juice of 2 limes. Taste and add more salt to the broth if
        needed.
    </li>
    <li>Cut the remaining lime into wedges for serving.</li>
    <li>Scatter a good handful of cilantro or basil over the shrimp and serve with
        baguette that's generously schmeared in cold butter and seasoned with salt
        and pepper.
    </li>
    <li>Spoon the shrimp and broth on the baguette and have yourself a real nice
        time!
    </li>
